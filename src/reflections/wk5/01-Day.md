## What is the Purpose of a JQuiery String?
 Within development of servers, the use of Query Parameters are implemented in almost every application. JQuiery allows for further applications to be added to the url of a server web location. These applications pass information back to a website and retreve it from the website.

## What is the format of a query param? How does it start? How do you destinguish between one param and the next?
 A query param usually is followed by the start of the query string which is marked by a ?. The param begins with a value that represents its key, an equals sign and the value. Each of these params are continued with an & symbol like this, 
  ```
  ?key1=val1&key2=val2
  ```

## When do you think query params would be helpful when writing your server?
 Query params are helpful for making a pathway within urls to pass information from data lists. In school, we write servers to store and manage data and the use of querys help with that ability.
