## In simple Terms what is a sub-document?
 A sub-document is the technique that simply means a document that is imbedded within another document. This is commonly used in mongoDB applications in reguard to schemas.

## When might you use a sub-doc?
 The use of a sub doc can be implemented when you have specific data that requires additional attributes that require more information and more data on each attribute. Like if you where describing an individual with a group of skill sets and there are like 3 different skill sets for that one individual.

## How do you add a collection of sub-documents? How would you edit them?
 Adding and editing sub-docs are all about imploying mongoose built in tools to add subdocs and edit them. Once creating the object within the server simply add an array of objects that apply with the parent document. Then editing is simply getting the correct object by id, then implementing push or post to add attributes to the object.
