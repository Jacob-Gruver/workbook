## What are three types of relationships? 
 There are three different kinds of relationships implemented in backend development. They are one to one, one to many, & many to many.

## What are the benefits of traditional linking of relationships instead of imbedding?
 Imbedding relationships are one of the many techniques involved with making servers however there are limits to its benefits. Using imbedding is better for smaller applications reguarding write document size and performance. Once a document grows to become too large, it causes issues with managing input and output data as the server has to componsate with all of the informatin padding and indexes.

## What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many to many relationship that drive your decision on how to create it?
 There are many relationship related decisins that have to be delt with and need to involve proper decision making to complete. The decision making has to involve the items of both entities and making decisions on how to develop a one way or two way embedding relationship.
