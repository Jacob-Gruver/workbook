# Day 4 of week 7 at Codeworks
__01/27/2021__
## Which princibles from this weeks reading did we implement?
 We implemented quite a few of the types of princibles displayed in the reading. One of these was while one of us drove the keyboard the other would point out the direction of the application. Another was as one drove for a while the other would take charge or try to.

## What went Well?
 Our communication went very well! We could discuss on the different directions that we needed to go in to achieve our end goal. The other thing that I personnaly feel good about was that we could effectively work and not butt heads with each other over small details or just not work well together.

## What would I do differently?
 I would like to have done more as far as the code itself. I felt like I wasnt in the code as much as I could have been, but I think I felt a little uncomfortable with my skill set specifically with typing and not annoying my partner with how slow I type.
