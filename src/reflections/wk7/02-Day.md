## What is code documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
 Code documentation is the art of producing documentation on how you and other developers and use, read, or maintain code. Code documentation can either be a page of just a how to guide, a read me md file with the folder of code, or sticking documentation within the source.

## What are some of the benefits of code documentation?
 Code documentation is specifically helpful for future use of code and how it can instruct users and other devs on the ins and outs of your old code. These benefits include reading after the fact when youve forgotten what you had done in the past to make it in the first place, using the code again and seeing what the logic was behind it, & of course fixing it if it gets broken.

## How important is code Documentation and why? 
 Providing code documentation is important for your code and should be implemented as much as possible. To achieve consistent understanding and to avoid headaches in the future, documentation is useful to understand your code.
