## What are two common operations that we will set in the handler?

 There are two common operators used within the handler. Those two operations are get & set.

## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
 
 Get in its default state only returns only the value in the key. This can be overridden to only return one value. In the situation where more values should be returned you must define the function with two parameters to return both values of the object and the property being accesed.

## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

 Proxies are useful in many ways like, keeping objects private and seting traps by looking for validations. Mostly for keeping objects private and trowing errors for accessing objects that are set to be private.
