# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The pillars of object oriented programming are Inheritance programming which is based on creating parent objects, Abstraction which is hiding unessesary info, Encapsulation which is making functions which can be used over and over and hiding them from outside interference, & Polymorphism which is the distinction of multiple forms of the same line of code and the proper use of said code. 
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
  I would access it by using the code,
  property.staff.name;
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
  Encapsulation is the process of wiriting code with respect of functions and reusable code and shielding it from outside interference.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The S in the SOLID principles represents Single Responsibility which refers to the single responsibility of an object like a class.
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
  The difference between a class and an instance of a class is that a class contains the acctual variable information while a class instance is a representation of said class.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 A proxy object is an object assighned to an id that makes it private from other types of code.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 An MVC pattern allows for neat organization and passing of data to be accessed by the user to each of the js files. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.  
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The Controller presents as a connection between the user imput to the js files that deal with the data and the buisness logic.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The Service js file is intended to work out the buisness logic of the DOM for the user.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The Model in the MVC works as the model object that presents as a comparable definition for data to describe an object.
```
