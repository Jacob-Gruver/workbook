## What problem does using exports solve?
 Using exports is a common practice professional coders implement. Why? Because it helps load pages faster than the "old" way of having multiple js files. The old way was setting each js page one after the other at the bottom of your body section in html. This presented a problem to loading the page because it took way too long for the page to load. By using exports, you are allowed to have multiple pages of code without making your webpage so sluggish.

## What is the difference between export and export default?

 Export and export default are two options of exporting classes or objects into different js files. Export is the use of exporting a named exports while export default works with unnamed exports.

## What is a benefit of using the module system?
 
 There are several benefits to using the module system. One of these benefits is it allows for easier debugging of code, another is it allows multiple js files to be concatinated in the same website.
