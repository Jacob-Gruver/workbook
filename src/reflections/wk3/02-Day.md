 Encapsulation is a technique used by developers to make effective code. It is used to make data more private by making it more local to the functions that act on that data.

## What where some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
 Some of the problems that had been tied to closures & underscore prefix was breaking changes. Breaking Changes involves prefixes that arent intended to be directly accessed by the API users.

## How to create private variables in ES6 classes & why would I use this specific method?

But creating classes with private variables help in the situation where you need a private variable to describe an object or data set that represents more of a perfect type of object hence using a class.
