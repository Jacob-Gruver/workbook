## What are Props?
 Props are a package of sorts that are passed between parent and child components/entities. This is useful except they can only be passed from parent to child and not from child to parent.

## What are props used for?
 As stated above, props are used as a package or a data shipper to ship data from parent entity to child. Props are mainly used to carry variables.

## Where can props be axcessed?
 Props can be axcessed through the html template. If you want to axcess it within the vue component it should be axcessed with the "this" keyword.
