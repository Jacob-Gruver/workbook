## What are lifestyle hooks?
 Lifestyle hooks are useful in vue frameworks due to being a log into when your components are used in a different way. They provide the lifecycle of your components when they are born, used, and die.

## What are lifestyle hooks used for?
 TLifestyle hooks are used to axcess or initualize certain components. Once this happens, this allows for full axcess and visualisation to each component and its lifecycle.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
 They are used to grab your component and use it as it is created. This allows for axcessing the component at a given time.
