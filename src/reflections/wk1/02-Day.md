# Day 2 at Boise Codeworks
__12/1/2020__

Day 2 at codeworks. It was awesome! And well sort of confusing. We went over both html & CSS and I can tell you that CSS is the tougher one. All I have to say is for some it takes time to be creative over CSS. It takes dedication and a lot of hours to fill out a regular page with desighn. 

## Ok so what is Pseudo Class & what common classes are used most often?

Pseudo Class is a type of defining class used in CSS to further describe or instruct a specific element within html to either appear or do. Phew! For instance, the class ":hover" can infact instruct an element to change when the mouse pointer "hovers" over it. It is also one of the many Pseudo Classes that, I think anyway, will be most used, alongside :target, :Required, & :fullscreen.

## What is Specificity? And what benefits can a coder get off of it?

What is Specificity? Well its pretty "specific" to the type of section of your webpage you are changing in CSS. This means that any CSS code that calls a specific element in html can be overidden by other opposite CSS that either is read last in the CSS document or it is in an html element that the first html tag resides within it. This can further be broken down to explain that all elements of html have a different level of Specificity value, which the CSS code that has the element with the higher number wins in the end. 

## What problems can arise if !Important is utilized too much.

The !Important command can be used to sort of override all other elements and can be the command that places its parent command as the higher number of Specificity. This is however not an ideal command to use. If overused it can screw with your code as the value inside the one CSS command can cover other important CSS code.
