# Day 1 at Boise Codeworks
 __11/30/2020__ 

 First day of codeworks in 2020. One word, stressful... and EXITING in a dificult to explain way. Apart from the regular "run of the mill" introductory day, we covered some important starting points for Git and why professional devs use it, what are branches and why are they so helpful in developing, &  what the major differences between Git and Github. 

 ## What first subject to address is, "What is Git, and why do we as Developers Use it

 In layman's terms, Git is an Open Source Code log that multiple Developers can use to "track" changes in a line of code. This is helpful because it provides the developers to "Browse their history" in a sense to undo actions or to understand why a specific application was used. This opens plenty of oppertunities for the developers to both write and troubleshoot code more efficiently. Git is also helpful due to its tracking ability to avoid a developer's code from contradicting another's. 

 ## The next Object to Address is the Benefits of having Multiple Branches 

 What on earth is a branch? Well we see branches every day, like the ones on birch trees, ever-greens, and... im teasing! I am refering to branches implemented within Github. These branches are simply directional arrows that point to a "branch off" of the Master branch. The branch off is the Test Branch. Each branch can have their own number of commits. (Commits are files of code that have been submitted to the local repository.) The reason why branches are useful for development is due to its ability to allow coders to work on two different commits in parallel. Doing this, as explained above help to avoid "disagrements".

 ## Now that ive bored you this far, what is the difference between Git and Github?

 Git and Github are simply two applications that are connected. By being connected, one (Git) is the app on your personal computer that connects with the code and is ajustable with commands you enter in your computer prompt. Its the side that sets up branches and commits for your code. Github is the online application that publishes your work live so that your peers, fellow devs that you work with, and buisnesses can observe the code you make.
