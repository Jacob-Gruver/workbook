## What is my favorite tip for improving my design?

I actually dont have a personal favorite from the tips given, but I do see the importance and helpfulness all of them provide. Really they are a guide for non artistic developers to go off of. To explain, adjustoing the colors of lesser paragraphs below their heading without changing their size is just as good as changing the direction of shadow outline of a card.

## What kind of resources are helpful to gather insperation for web design? 

The best that I can think of from the resources that can provide inspiration can be websites like sansfransis.co which provides both pictures you can put on your website and free examples to view in order to inspire yourself. Another is the web itself. You can look at other websites and look at what they have done with their visuals. Most of them have the same kinds of techniques.

## What is the purpose of design and what can a web visitor recieve from the design of a website

There is a lot that someone can get off of the design choice of a website. That would include professionalism through a design choice that is tidy, colorful and yet not too colorful, and complementary to the theme of the website. The second positive factor that design of a website can provide is the emotions it can create. For instance color and format can be great factors in desplaying the atmosphere of a website.
