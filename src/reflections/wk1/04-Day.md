## What is the general purpose of wireframing?

Wireframing is the developers tool to "outline" a website so that they can visually design the website before they touch their code. Its kind of like making a plan before going into battle. It helps devs cognetively conceve their sites so that they have a launching pad to get started from.

## What is the three types of wireframes and why are they useful?

The forst wireframe is low fidelity wireframing which is the basic of the basic. Its usually your first rough draft to start with and is used as a starting pitch for your site. The second is mid fidelity wireframing which is the electronic drawing of your website and is the second layer of decision making for your websites. It offers more descriptive detail into your rough draft without your pictures or text. The third and final stage of wireframing is high fidelity wireframing. This final stage is the type that finally implements acctual content like pictures and text that relate with the theme of the website. It usually can be a tool for the devs to take their pitches onto code.

## Is a wireframe useful or a waste of time?

I think wireframes are very useful due to their ability to promote good decisions and edit the vision of a website to something more realistic and clean. There have to be preparation steps to wiriting a good paper, which is first writing an outline and making a rough draft that helps idenify the faults and help improve on the final result in the long run.
