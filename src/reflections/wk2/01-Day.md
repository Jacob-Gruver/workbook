 ## What is Scope? And how does it apply to var, let, & const?

 Scope, in terms of initializing variables, describes the behavior of var, let, or const in reguard to placement within the code. There is usually three different scopes that identify this factor, Block scoped, function/locally, & Global. Global refers to a variable that is being described outside of a function and is available for implementation throughout the entire window. var variables are usually globally scoped outside of a function. Function/locally also applies to var. It is the scope of a var that is called within a funcion and means that it is only available within that function. The last scope, block scoped, applies to both let & const. Block scope revers to block of code that is represented by curly braces. It efectively also means that it cannot be accessed outside of a function or other form of block code.

 ## What is Hoisting and how does it effect var, let, const?

 Hoistiing is the computer's action of observing a variable that is either called by var, let, const by observing them at the top of the code block if the requirements are met, or to the top of a function. Usually Hoisting is affected by the scope of a variable.

 ## In what cases may I use var over let and let over const?

 It all depends of I need something declaired that I want changed, or just updated, or just to stay the same. For instance, I would use var to declare a function that I need to call a new value to. I can use var to either be declaired globally or locally. If I am going to use let, I would use it to declare a value that I only need to be updated. And if I wanted to call a const I would want it to be the same for an eternity.
