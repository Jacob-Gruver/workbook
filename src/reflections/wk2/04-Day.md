## What is the benefit of making a plan before writing code?

One big benefit of planning before code aids in avoiding technical debt and garbage code! Planning before code forces a developer to fully grasp the problem at hand and the solution to remedying the issues with his initial solution. Plan, research, plan some more, code, check the code, and rewrite when needed.

## If your stuck on a problem, how do you solve the problem?

Being stuck is a tough spot to be in. It encourages people to procrastinate or quit. One remedy for this issue is RESEARCH! Specifically in code you will never be at the top of the curve! You have to keep learning to keep up with the change of technology.

## From the article provided, which is my takeaway?

Avoiding Technical Debt!! I am a noob at coding in general and I have a lot of time, energy, & effort to apply into code to become a professional developer. One of the first mountain to hurdle is avoid writing garbage code, and make code cleaner.
